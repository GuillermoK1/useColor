# useColor
A theme selector composable for changing the colors of some components, texts, backgrounds, etc...

## Usage
Check the default layout template to understand the usage. The colors are costumizable but in my case I used the original colors from Tailwind's safelist. Check Tailwind's docs for customizing your colors.
